## ECON 103 Project 2

This will be cleaned up after session is over, but for now it includes all scratch work. Please refer to nyse.py and wiki_scrape.py to understand how I got data for Russel_2000, sp400, and sp500. NYSE.py was responsible for the random picking of around 1000 stocks of which 700 were valid. After this Project2_stock_enchanced.Rmd does all the rest of the work. Please contact me at vivekgarg2004@gmail.com if you have questions/concerns about the data collection process.
